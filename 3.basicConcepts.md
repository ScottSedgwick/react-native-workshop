# Basic Concepts

A quick overview of React...

## React

React is a declarative framework with the intention of making changes to views a lot more predictable and understandable to all web developers.

**How?** You may ask... Have you heard of MVVM, reactive programming and immutability?

Trying to explain it, in react you create components (view) that have its initial state (immutable model) and the state that can change (view model). When the state changes, react knows there is a part of the state that changes (the view model is a kind of observable object) and creates a whole new view, replacing the view presented to the user with the new immutable view.

Now... there are a few additional things that will happen in the process of replacing the old view with the new... but that is the summary. 

### React Example

```tsx
/**
  * This example allows you to print on a browser 
  * greetings to the knower of nothing.
  */
import * as React from "react";

interface HelloWorldProps {
    userName: string;
}

class HelloWorldComponent extends React.Component<HelloWorldProps> {
    constructor(props) { super(props); }

    render() {
        return (<div>Hello ${this.props.userName}!</div>);
    }
}

ReactDOM.render(<HelloWorldComponent userName="Jon Snow" />);
```

But what about if we want to show something else? Something that will be updated after a little bit of time (like an HTTP request)

```tsx
import * as React from "react";

function getWeather(place: string): Promise<string> {
    const queryUri = `https://samples.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=${place}&appid=b6907d289e10d714a6e88b30761fae22`;

    return fetch(queryUri)
        .then(x => x.weather.description)
        .catch(x => "Could not get the weather! Sorry!");
}

interface WeatherProps {
    place: string;
}

interface WeatherState {
    weatherMessage: string;
    ohNo?: boolean;
}

class WeatherComponent extends React.Component<WeatherProps> {
    constructor(props) {
        super(props);

        this.state = { weatherMessage: "" };
    }

    componentDidMount() {
        queryUri(this.props.place)
            .then(x => this.setState(prev => { weatherMessage: x }))
            .catch(e => this.setState(prev => { ...prev, ohNo: true }));
    }

    render() {
        if (this.state.onNo) {
            return (<div class="badMessage">Something horrible happened.</div>);
        }
        return (<div>${this.state.weatherMessage}</div>)
    }
}

ReactDOM.render(<WeatherComponent place="Sydney, Au" />);
```


## React Native

Apply the same philosophy to the components, but change the HTML tags with actual views.

### React Native Example

```tsx
import * as React from "react";
import { View, Text } from "react-native"; // <- this is new!

interface HelloWorldProps {
    userName: string;
}

class HelloWorldComponent extends React.Component<HelloWorldProps> {
    constructor(props) { super(props); }

    render() {
        // this following part has changed as well!
        return ( 
            <View>
                <Text>Hello ${this.props.userName}!</Text>
            </View>);
    }
}
```

You don't need to call the render method from the DOM, because the framework (injected into a native view) is creating the native objects for you as you reference them.

In the case of iOS, a `<View />` is translated into a `UIView`; in android it would be a `android.view`, in HTML (react-native-web) it would be a `<div />` or in Windows (react-native-windows) it would be either a `<Grid />` or `<LayoutPanel />` (it depends on other properties given to it).

## So... What's the difference?

React (or reactJs) is a web technology, React Native is the port of the same contracts to the native world. In fact, some websites (such as squarespace) decided to close the gap of their implementations by using react-native-web on their websites and react-native on their apps, having all developers talking the **same language**.
