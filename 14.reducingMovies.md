### Starting the migration to redux

Going back to the `HomeView`, we want to be able to fetch the information from the store. But, to achieve that we need to first turn the `HomeView` into a container.

1. In `./src/views`, create a `containers` and a `components` folder.
2. Create a file called `./src/views/containers/homeView.tsx` a copy all the content of `./src/views/homeView.tsx` in it.
3. Fix the imports to the appropriate paths.
4. Create a component called `movieItem.tsx` and move the component of the `renderMovie` method in it (from the `View`).
    1. Do not configure the new component with a database, pass the minimum required (`title` and `poster`).
    2. Export it so we can use it in the container.
5. Refactor the code of `renderMovie` with the new component.
6. To turn the view into a container we need to do the following code (add it at the bottom of the file):
```tsx
function mapStoreToProps(store: any) { // we still don't know what our store looks like.
    return {
        movies: store.movies,
    };
}

const actions = undefined; // we still have not created actions to map.

const HomeViewContainer = connect(mapStoreToProps, actions)(HomeView);

export { HomeViewContainer };
```
7. Remove the export of `HomeView` as we don't need that any more.
8. We need an action to fetch the movies. Let's crate 

### Adding the store

Let's think about what we need to know...

1. The movies.
2. Later on we need the selected movie.
3. And my wishlist.

Let's create a type that is going to match our store.

```tsx
interface Store {
    movies: Movie[];

    selectedMovie?: Movie; // the '?' indicates that can be undefined...

    wishlist: Movie[];
}
```

This definition is not final, we haven't check what other state is meaningful to put here.
