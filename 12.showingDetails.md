1. Rename `handleTap` to `showMovieDetails`
2. Close on the movie so the handler knows which movie you are dealing with.
3. Remove whatever is giving you issues as part of the change of `handleTap`
4. The `push` of a new route, also takes second argument called parameters. Provide to it an object with a single property called `selectedMovie`.
5. Check everything works.
6. Now, the screen initiating the navigation provides the selected movie, but details is not pulling it out. To do this:
    1. Create a type called `NavParams` that matches the object passed as part of the previous `push` call.
    2. Check the type definition of `NavigationScreenProps` used by `DetailsView`. Provide the new type where required.
    3. In `render`, get the parameter matching the selected movie into a constant.
7. Display the title, original title, language, vote average  and movie overview. Don't worry it looks all like crap, we will get it looking better in a bit.
